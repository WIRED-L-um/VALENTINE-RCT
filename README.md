Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Remotely Delivered Mobile Health Intervention to Augment Cardiac Rehabilitation


Participants in both groups received a smartwatch and usual care in the form of CR. Participants in the intervention group received a comprehensive mHealth intervention designed to augment and extend the benefits of CR.


Study Groups: All participants received a smartwatch for outcome assessments and usual care in the form of CR. Participants were followed for 6-months. 


Study Outcomes: The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance from baseline to 6-months as measured remotely using the mobile study application and smartwatch. Two additional secondary outcomes. 
1. Change in mean daily step count between the first 7-days of the study prior to intervention receipt and the final 7-days of the study.
3. Change in quality-of-life scores over 6-months as measured by the EuroQol visual analog scale.
